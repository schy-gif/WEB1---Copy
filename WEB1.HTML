	<div class="block1"> The web is a place made by us and that remakes us. In every adaptation on the web, we too are changed. WHOIS wants to explore the web's territory as a place that can and should be made after our <span class="rightTocity"> heart’s desire</span>. But beyond its emancipatory capabilities, we also wish to explore the ways in which the web becomes a place of constraint, of familiar dynamics, of bad options. The ability to be anonymous online has yet to free us from the entrenched hierarchies of power that inform contemporary society, accelerating technocapitalism in terrifying ways. As we wander through the unfamiliar, we also return to the well-known. <br> </br>

With each issue, WHOIS will highlight tender, critical and generative responses to our world on the web.  Calling upon all kinds of contributions to produce a diverse portrait of the online trails we stamp out, to expose the myths, the everyday stories and profound and mundane experiences with a technology whose shifting forms and functions are both a response and reflection of the people that shape it. 

</div>
	<div class="block2"> WHOIS is now taking submissions of pitches, papers, projects and research for its inaugural issue in response to the theme firsts. <br> </br>

As a consequence of being online, we are subjected to an infinite series of firsts. When only so much can be consumed, everything we see on the internet competes for first. Update cycles and algorithms promote novelty and competitiveness, sorting content based on what should be first, and thus making it so. Being a technology of adaptation, the web is constantly being remade and reimagined by its users, making firsts common place. When an “original” source gets obscured by its maniacal reproduction, what happens to the significance of its first iteration? What we see in subsequent manipulations might be considered numerous firsts of their own. <br> </br>

Firsts can be exciting and thrilling but they can also be exhausting and unproductive. We are interested in the ways users repurpose and anew the web for good for bad and for fun. For those of us “born digital” and those who endured the struggle and excitements of “learning” the web we are asking you to reflect on any instances of internet firsts, whatever that means to you.<br> </br>

We are accepting submissions in all formats. Send us your ideas for interviews, reviews, essays, fiction or art projects; or send us completed but unpublished work. We can pay $50-$100 depending on length and scope of the piece. Please refer to our prompts below if you’d like, and take a look at our Links page for projects, events and texts that got us thinking about firsts. <br> </br>

Show us how a platform has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-egg-experimental-new-app-personalized-webpages-nostalgia-2020-11">evolved</a>, or how an application’s function has been <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html>repurposed</a>. What were the unique outcomes of this change? Did it bring users together in new ways? Tell us about a glitch, an uncaught error or a side effect that changed an application’s function or the way we understood something. Explore an instance when the internet resurfaced something from the past, making it new again. Think about a formative experience you had with or on the web. Follow a lead about the first person or community who did something differently. Following the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/information-preservation/digital-heritage/concept-digital-heritage">UNESCO Digital Heritage</a> project, tell us about an internet artifact you deem worthy of preservation. We want your incisive, interesting and honest reflections on the ambivalence of the internet.
